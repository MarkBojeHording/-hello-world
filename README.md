# -hello-world

Hello, my name is Mark Hording. I've recently started my journey into programming and coding and currently following the front-end developing paths on Treehouse and Codeacademy. It is very exciting and challenging, as there is alot of information and learning to absorb - but I'm currently coding 2-3 hours a day as I have a full time job, doing small challenges on Codeacademy, watching youtube tutorials and keeping up with news on twitter and discord. I'm currently also doing challenges on StackUp and Web3 University.
I will be posting projects from my tutorials following the front-end engineer path and other minor projects along the way.
